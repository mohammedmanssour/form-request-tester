# Laravel FormRequest Tester

A Simple collection of test helpers that help testing form request the easy way.

## Why Bother

for full story on why this package was built please refer to [This Blog Post](https://mohammedmanssour.me/blog/testing-laravel-form-request/)

## Installation

1. Using composer

```
composer require --dev mohammedmanssour/form-request-tester
```

2. add `MohammedManssour\FormRequestTester\TestsFormRequests` trait to your test case.

## Testing a form request

1. you need to intialize the form request using `formRequest` method, it takes the FormRequest class as first argument and an array of request data as a second argument

```php
$this->formRequest(UpdatePost::class, [
    'title' => 'New Title',
    'content' => 'Some Content here'
])
```

or you can use the intuitive methods to set form request method and data

```php
$this->formRequest(UpdatePost::class)
->post([
    'title' => 'New Title',
    'content' => 'Some Content here'
])
```

the previous code will intialize the request with `post` method and `/fake-route` if you want to change these options you can via the options array that can be set as a third argument

```php
$this->formRequest(UpdatePost::class, [
    'title' => 'New Title',
    'content' => 'Some Content here'
], [
    'method' => 'put',
    'route' => 'posts/{post}'
])
```

```php
$this->formRequest(UpdatePost::class)
->put([
    'title' => 'New Title',
    'content' => 'Some Content here'
])
->withRoute('posts/{post}')
```

2. use the available assertions to test for request

### Available Assertions

|                                                    |                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$this->assertValidationPassed()`                  | To make sure the validation have passed successfully with the help of the provided data.                       |
| `$this->assertValidationFailed()`                  | To make sure the validation have failed with the help of the provided data.                                    |
| `$this->assertValidationErrors($keysArray)`        | To assert that the keys mentioned in the `$keysArray` have occurred in the errors bag.                         |
| `$this->assertValidationErrorsMissing($keysArray)` | To assert that the keys mentioned in the `$keysArray` have not occurred in the errors bag.                     |
| `$this->assertValidationMessages($messagesArray)`  | To assert that the messages exists in the error bag. Used when you define custom messages for your validation. |
| `$this->assertAuthorized()`                        | To assert that request have been authorized via the form request.                                              |
| `$this->assertNotAuthorized()`                     | To assert that request have not been authorized via the form request.                                          |
| `$this->assertValidationData($keysArray)`          | To assert that the keys mentioned in the `$keysArray` have occurred in the validated data.                     |
| `$this->assertValidationDataMissing($keysArray)`   | To assert that the keys mentioned in the `$keysArray` have not occurred in the validated data.                 |

### Example Usage:

Taking into consderation:

1. title & content are required field,
2. **Content field is required** is a custom error message used for content field
3. `$this->route` method is used in authorize method
4. `Route::put('posts/{post}', 'PostsController@update')` is the route used to update a post

```php
$this->formRequest(UpdatePost::class,[
    'title' => 'New Title'
],[
    'method' => 'put'
    'route' => 'posts/{post}'
])->assertAuthorized()
->assertValidationFailed()
->assertValidationErrors(['content'])
->assertValidationErrorsMissing(['title'])
->assertValidationMessages(['Content field is required'])
```

you can now use intuitive methods to build form request

```php
$this->formRequest(UpdatePost::class)
->put([
    'title' => 'New Title'
])
->withRoute('posts/1')
->assertAuthorized()
->assertValidationFailed()
->assertValidationErrors(['content'])
->assertValidationErrorsMissing(['title'])
->assertValidationMessages(['Content field is required'])
```

## Form Requests related methods and how to work with them

### `$this->route('parameter')`:

This method basically retreive the value of a routing rule parameter.

For example if you have a routing rule `put posts/{post}` and browsed to `posts/1` then the value of `$this->route('post')` is **1**.
for this to work with the package you need to

1. Register the routing rule in your application routing files `web.php` or `api.php`

```php
Route::put('posts/{post}', [PostsController::class, 'update']);
```

2. set the route using **FormRequestTester** `withRoute` method

```php
$this->formRequest(UpdatePost::class)
    ->put($data)
    ->withRoute('posts/1');
```

this why when you use the `$this->route('post')` in your form request, the result will be **1**.

The package also supports substitube binding. All you need to be is to Ø¤reate an explicit binding and will do the work for you.

```php
// somewhere in your app ðŸ¤”, ideally, your service provider
Route::model('post', Post::class);
```

when you do the reigster, the value of `$this->route('post')` will be a **Post** model rather than the id.

**Alternatively**

if you don't want to register a route just for the sake of resolving a route parameter then you can use **FormRequestTester** `addRouteParameter($name, $value)`.

```php
$this->formRequest(UpdatePost::class)
    ->put($data)
    ->addRouteParameter('post', 1)
    ->assertAuthorized();
```

according to the example above, with the new method `addRouteParameter`, `$this->route('post')` will be resolved to **1**

### `$this->user()`:

This method will reteive the current authenticated user.

use laravel testing method `actingAs` to set a user as the current authenticated user

```php
$user = User::factory()->create();
$this->actingAs($user);
```
